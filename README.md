# Food Delivery Intelligence Insights From Swiggy Restaurant Data Using-PYTHON

This project aims to analyze the Restaurant Dataset obtained from a food delivery platform using Python libraries
such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal of this analysis is to understand how different factors
such as average rating, total reviews, cuisine types, cost for two, and online delivery availability influence
restaurant popularity and performance.
Overall, the project focuses on transforming raw restaurant data into useful insights that can help understand
customer preferences, restaurant quality, and market behavior in the online food delivery industry.
